# Osu! Data Visiualizations 

This repo is the visual part of our Osu! (light) Data analysis. It also follows directly after the other `osu_data_mining` repository. In the first part, I demonstrated how I gathered the data.  

  

I plan to analyze the datasets into the following parts: 

1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Descriptive Statistics 
3. Model 

  

The first part is really just exploring what the datasets holds. There is also some modeling here and there, but I don't make and in-depth analysis. This part of the analysis is pretty easy since I have some familiarity with the game. I'll explain the game in the next section.  

  

The second part of this analysis goes in depth the key things we found in the first part. I anticipate most of what I display will be common knowledge to users of Osu!. I hope to shed some light, i.e. quantify, into things we as players already know.  

  

Modeling. This part of the analysis is my favorite. I plan to go in depth how we can model player performance. 

  

## What is Osu!? (brief) 

Osu! is a free-to-play rhythm-based game found on [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). The goal for a player is to click circles according the rhythm of a selected song. These songs are known as 'beatmaps'. Some beatmaps/maps are easy to play, and some maps are hard to play. Each map offers some 'performance points' (abrv.  as `pp`) after completion.  Performance is based on difficulty (vaguely speaking), accuracy (how close they are to the rhythm), speed (the bpm/pace of the song), circle count (the number of notes in a particular map), and other things. A playerâ€™s overall performance rating is based on their best 50 performances. The ranking system is based on overall performance. The most skilled player is the one with the highest overall performance.
